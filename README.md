## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? In order to aquire this new skill and further my career. 
- Why did you build this project? I wanted to give myself practice for future applications in this field. 
- What problem does it solve? This assignments taught me to solve certain issues such as cleaning up the code from clutter and repetitive code, certain annotations needed to give the "div" a different other than staying generic with no meaning. Also just the basic functionality of the tabs when you click on them, they navigate to the specific term you select stc.
- What did you learn? I learned the very basics of Html and CSS working together to clean up code, move certain text and images, and also being able to review alot of the terms that we've learned these last few days in class.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
